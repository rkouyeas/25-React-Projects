# 25 React Projects

A collection of 25 small React projects built inside a single React + TypeScript + Vite application.  
Each project explores a different React concept â€” from state management and hooks to APIs and UI interactions.  
The goal is to strengthen front-end skills through practical, self-contained mini builds.

_Each project can be found in the `src/components` folder and rendered from `App.tsx`._
